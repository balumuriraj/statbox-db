The film stars the late Nageswara Rao, Nagarjuna and Naga Chaitanya along with Shriya Saran and Samantha. Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan done a Special appearance in this movie. StoryEntire movie deals from the year 1920 to 2013 and this is the last movie of Nageswara Rao. 'Manam' is a story filled with joy and rejoicing in reuniting with the lost ones.Watch out for that similarities in the behaviour of the two Nagarjunas. When he is wooing his beloved one, one time as a man still a child at heart and the second time as a rich bachelor savouring his moments with his chosen girl, he self-forgetfully loses his social identity to become an individual showing nothing but unconditional love.It's not wise to compare the performance of Nag and the legendary actor, Late ANR, but somehow the film seems like a Nag film. That fabulous scene in which he expresses a pleasant surprise at having seen his 'father' inside the plane. That fabulous scene in which he becomes nervous when he finds his 'mother', not knowing that he is holding in his hands a book by name 'The world's greatest mom'. ANR is seen in a one-of-its-kind role. He is full of josh and, like Nag, exudes that child-like rapture at seeing his beloved ones. On the flip side, his role is shorter than one would have expected.Naga Chaitanya is relatively seen in more number of scenes and he does that rom-com act and everything with ease. He strikes a good chemistry with Samantha, yet again. Samantha, too, has got many scenes and she gets her emotional act right.  But it is her scenes with Nag which are truly fun to watch; she is such a natural in her scenes with Nag. Shreya proves her mettle yet again. Watch her when she says to Nag about impending marriage with some important person who found her lovable.ANR saying to Chai, \"Prathi vadu tagi Devadas antadu,\" is such a treat to watch. Yes, ANR takes pride in boozing here!All the main characters have a meaningful place in the story. The climax gives that surreal feel.Anoop Rubens scored music, while Harshavardan written dialogues for this movie.  MarketingThe first look poster of the film was released on September 19, 2013, on the eve of Akkineni Nageswara Rao's 90th birthday.

{"_id":{"$numberInt":"648"},"genre":["Action"],"title":"Vishwaroopam","description":"Viswaroopam is a dubbed version of Tamil movie Viswaroopam. Its much awaited movie of Kamal Hassan's biggest-ever film, which has been delayed for one or the other reason, has seen the light of day in foreign countries but not in Tamil Nadu and other Southern states as the High Court has stayed the release after several Muslim groups raised objection. After a gap of three years, Kamal Hassan is back with Viswaroopam, which is written, directed and produced by himself. The film was supposed to be directed by Selvaraghavan but as the director walked out of the film due to other commitments, Kamal took the responsibility of directing the film. The film is simultaneously made in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. It is made with the budget of Rs 95 crore, which is the second highest budget Tamil film after Rajinikanth's blockbuster Endhiran. What does the multilingual action-thriller has to offer? A reader named Praveen Kumar from New Jersey reviewed the film, as the movie was not released here. Read on for the review.The movie starts in America. Viswanath (Kamal Hassan), who will be seen as Kathak trainer, is surrounded by girls and one among them is Andrea Jeremiah. This makes Dr Nirupama (Pooja Kumar) to doubt on her hubby's character and hires a detective, who gets killed by Al-Qaeda group. The Al-Qaeda is planning to plant a Nuclear Bomb in New York and Kamal Hassan is well-aware of it. How? He has a past where he has a connection with the terrorist group, which is headed by Omar (Rahul Bose). Will the terrorist organisation succeed in their mission? What role does Kamal play? Is he a terrorist or an undercover agent? To know all these, you should watch the film. The story of the film begins on a slow note but it is gripping. The first half is entirely shot in the US, and keeps you engaged and generate a lot of curiosity. When it comes to second half, the narration is dragging at parts but gets interesting with Kamal Hassan's past getting revealed.Viswaroopam has a wonderful story. It is well-backed by technical aspects like action and cinematography. It has to be noted that only one song will be part of the film even though the album of the film has a couple of tracks.

Director Srikanth Addala and producer Dil Raju have done it and dared to bring two superstars (Mahesh Babu and Venkatesh) together on screen with Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (SVSC), which has hit the marquee today. The much-hyped movie, which had created huge expectations among the film goers, is really a wonderful flick that suits the image of the superstars and it is a big treat for their fans this Sankranthi. Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu is a complete family drama with a few commercial elements. The performances of Mahesh Babu and Venkatesh are the main attractions in the film. Srikanth Addala's brilliant narration and dialogues, Mickey J Meyer's melodious music, KV Guhan's beautiful picturisation are its other highlights. What the film lacks is the absence of lead actors' heroism and slow-paced narration in the second half. The movie narrates a simple and beautiful story, which revolves around a middle class family. The movie is all about brother sentiment. With his brilliant storytelling, Srikanth Addala has brought out the emotions between various characters in the family in a realistic way. The first half of the film is very interesting with few heart touching moments and songs. The second half is also good, but it falls short to catch up fast with the pace of the narration. Relangi Mavayya (Prakash Raj) is a gentleman from a small village Relangi and he believes in human values and relationships. He has two sons Peddodu aka Mallikharjuna Rao (Venkatesh) and Chinnodu aka Seetha Rama Raju (Mahesh Babu). Peddodu is an emotional guy and his maradalu Seetha (Anjali) is in love with him since her childhood. Whereas Mahesh Babu is a witty and charming young man and he falls in love with Geetha (Samantha), the daughter of Rao Ramesh. But Rao Ramesh ridicules Prakash Raj for his low wealth and this strains the relationships between both brothers. What happens next will form the crux of the story of Seetamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu.","cert":"U","url":"https://www.filmibeat.com/telugu/movies/seethamma-vakitlo-sirimalle-chettu.html","poster":"https://www.filmibeat.com/img/220x275/popcorn/movie_posters/seethamma-vakitlo-sirimalle-chettu-10960.jpg","runtime":null,"releasedate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1357891200000"}},"__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}
